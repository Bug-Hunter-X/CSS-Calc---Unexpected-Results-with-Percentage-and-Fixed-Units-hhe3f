The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there's a common error when using it with percentages and other units:  `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works perfectly. But  `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not produce the expected result if the containing element is not 100% wide itself.  The calculation is performed relative to the containing element, and if that container is smaller, the result can be unexpected.
